# ChatVPet

# VPet's life is only two minutes, I want to give her a full life
**ChatVPet**, the ChatPet language model. It is trained based on ChatPet chat data. It is similar to ChatGPT in AI chat. We have tested the ChatPet AI chat for a period of time and found that the untrained AI performs very poorly. There are many problems such as slow response and random speech.
So we started the **ChatVPet** project, which is to give us chat data to help us train the AI of our VPets. We plan to train the AI from scratch ourselves and make an exclusive AI training library for the Virtual Pets Simulator. **ChatVPet** is based on **ChatGLM-6B** and uses **LLaMA-Factory** to collect and train from user chat data

All training data collection has been approved by the user. [Training Protocol](TrainingProtocol.md)
